# Containers
<p>Containers has definitely not been the easiest subject for me to learn but as always, I'm going to keep pushing until I understand it.</p>
<p>First things first, I'm a visual learner so I had to know what I'm "looking" at before I get started.</p>

<h1>Node:</h1>
  <p>There are 2 different types:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Control Plane or Master Node: This is the brains of the operation dealing with the deployment, scheduling and self-healing of the containers</li>
    <li>Worker Node: This is where apps run in your cluster; completely comtrolled by the Master node.</li>
  </ol>
